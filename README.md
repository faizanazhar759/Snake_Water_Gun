- 📊 Scoreboard and difficulty levels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (`python3-tk`)
- Pygame (`pygame`)
- Pillow (`Pillow`)

### Installation Instructions (Linux)

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-water-gun-game.git
   cd snake-water-gun-game


Set Up a Virtual Environment: Install venv if you don’t have it:

<!-- bash -->

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

Create a virtual environment:

<!-- bash -->

python3 -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment:

<!-- bash -->

source .venv/bin/activate

## Future Improvements
    Add Timed Decisions: Introduce a timer for player moves.
    Enhance AI: Implement smarter AI using machine learning.
    Multiplayer Mode: Allow two players to compete locally.

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!

### 3. Additional Improvements

Here are some additional suggestions to enhance the game:

1. **Graphics Enhancements:**
   - Add animations or transition effects to make the game more dynamic.
   - Use higher-quality images or GIFs for better visual appeal.

2. **Enhanced AI Logic:**
   - Improve the AI with a more sophisticated algorithm to make the computer's decisions less predictable.

3. **Multiplayer Feature:**
   - Implement a two-player mode where players can compete against each other on the same machine.

4. **Difficulty Scaling:**
   - Adjust difficulty dynamically based on player performance.

5. **Leaderboard:**
   - Implement a leaderboard to keep track of high scores.

By following these steps and suggestions, you’ll set up your GitHub repository properly and make your project accessible and engaging for others. If you need more help with any specific part, feel free to ask!
